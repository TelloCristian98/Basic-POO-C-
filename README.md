# Basic OOP program in C#

This project has two classes and one interface for applying basic OOP concepts such as Inheritance, Polymorphism, Interfaces.

## Indications

The class "Empleado" has two atributes "nombre," and "sueldo." Each atribute has its getter and setter method. The class has its constructor.

The class "Gerente" inheritance from the class "Empleado" and add an atribute called "departamento". This class also has its constructors.

There is an Interface that has a method "mostrarInformacion()" and it is implemented in the class "Empleado". As a result, this method is Inheritance for the class "Gerente."

The class Principal shows the objects that are referenced to the classes and it has the main method that runs the proram.
